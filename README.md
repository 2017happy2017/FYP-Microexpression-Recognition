# FYP-Microexpression-Recognition
Deepface is a lightweight face recognition and facial attribute analysis framework that developed by [Sefik Ilkin Serengil](http://https://github.com/serengil/deepface#face-recognition.com). My final project title is *Facial Micro-Expressions Recognition Based on Transfer Learning*. Transfer Learning is a machine method where a model is trained for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on task. Likewise, DeepFace framework already have a pre-trained model to detect macro-expressions that can be reused on micro-expressions recognition.




## test



```python
pip install deepface
```
